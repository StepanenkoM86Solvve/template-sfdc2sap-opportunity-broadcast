# License Agreement
This template is subject to the conditions of the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/templates-examples/AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf">MuleSoft License Agreement</a>. Review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. You can use this template for free with the Mule Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio. 
# Use Case
<!-- Use Case (start) -->
This Anypoint template serves as a foundation for setting an online sync of won opportunities from Salesforce to Sales orders in SAP.
Every time there is a new won opportunity or a change in an already existing one with assigned Account in Salesforce instance, the template will fetch it and send it to SAP to upsert sales order there.
			
Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.
			
As implemented, this template leverages the Mule batch module.
The batch job is divided into *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

The integration is triggered by scheduler to Salesforce opportunities. New or modified opportunities, which fulfill *IsWon* and *HasAccount* criteria are passed to the batch as input.
In the batch, the sales order is fetched from SAP by its purchase order number equal to opportunity ID.
If it exists, more sales order details are fetched from SAP.

In next batch step if the property account.sync.policy is set to 'syncAccount', the customer is looked up by opportunity account name.
If the customer is found, its sales areas are fetched from SAP and first one is selected to be used for sales order creation.
If it is not found, then the dummy customer is used with pre-configured sales area and customer number.
On the other hand, if the property account.sync.policy is set to different value, the pre-configured sales area and customer number are used.
Template doesn't support changing customer of the existing sales order.

Another step creates or updates sales order in SAP. 
Finally during the On Complete stage the template logs output statistics data into the console.

<!-- Default Considerations (end) -->

<!-- Considerations (start) -->
To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made for the template to run smoothly.
**Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Before continue with the use of this template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work 
with SAP and Anypoint Studio.

## Disclaimer

This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies from Mulesoft in order to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, you need to add three extra dependencies for SAP to the pom.xml file.

## SAP Considerations

Here's what you need to know to get this template to work with SAP.


### As a Data Destination

There are no considerations with using SAP as a data destination.
## Salesforce Considerations

Here's what you need to know about Salesforce to get this template to work:

- Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=checking_field_accessibility_for_a_particular_field.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field</a>.
- Can I modify the Field Access Settings? How? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=modifying_field_access_settings.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings</a>.

### As a Data Source

If the user who configured the template for the source system does not have at least *read only* permissions for the fields that are fetched, then an *InvalidFieldFault* API fault displays.

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: [InvalidFieldFault [ApiQueryFault 
[ApiFault  exceptionCode='INVALID_FIELD'
exceptionMessage='Account.Phone, Account.Rating, Account.RecordTypeId, 
Account.ShippingCity
^
ERROR at Row:1:Column:486
No such column 'RecordTypeId' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting to 
use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom field name. 
Reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'
]
row='1'
column='486'
]
]
```

+ scheduler.frequency `10000`
+ scheduler.start.delay `1000`
+ watermark.default.expression `2014-08-14T10:15:00.000Z`

+ account.sync.policy `syncAccount`	

**Note:** the property **account.sync.policy** can take any of the two following values: 
+ **empty_value**: if the property has no value assigned to it then application will do nothing in respect to the account and it'll just assign the account and sales areas from the properties file.
+ **syncAccount**: it will try to get and fetch sales areas data from SAP Customer if it exists.

# API Calls
<!-- API Calls (start) -->
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. However, in this template, only one call per poll cycle is done to retrieve all the information required.

# Customize It!
This brief guide provides a high level understanding of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs. As Mule applications are based on XML files, this page describes the XML files used with this template. More files are available such as test classes and Mule application files, but to keep it simple, we focus on these XML files:

* config.xml
* businessLogic.xml
* endpoints.xml
* errorHandling.xml<!-- Customize it (start) -->

<!-- Customize it (end) -->

## config.xml
<!-- Default Config XML (start) -->
This file provides the configuration for connectors and configuration properties. Only change this file to make core changes to the connector processing logic. Otherwise, all parameters that can be modified should instead be in a properties file, which is the recommended place to make changes.<!-- Default Config XML (end) -->

<!-- Config XML (start) -->

<!-- Config XML (end) -->

## businessLogic.xml
<!-- Default Business Logic XML (start) -->
The business logic XML file creates or updates objects in the destination system for a represented use case. You can customize and extend the logic of this template in this XML file to more meet your needs.<!-- Default Business Logic XML (end) -->

<!-- Business Logic XML (start) -->

<!-- Business Logic XML (end) -->

## endpoints.xml
<!-- Default Endpoints XML (start) -->

<!-- Endpoints XML (start) -->

<!-- Endpoints XML (end) -->

## errorHandling.xml
<!-- Default Error Handling XML (start) -->
This file handles how your integration reacts depending on the different exceptions. This file provides error handling that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.<!-- Default Error Handling XML (end) -->
